Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one. Now not here to talk  about that today but I'm  wondering if you guys have ever  wondered about the effective of  lithiumine or gaba for ADHD. So  if you have drop me a yes in  the comments below. Um because  that's what I'm going to be  talking about today. Now  earlier this week someone asked  me specifically about these and  I know it's something that I've  been asked many times before.  So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea. Now lit  theanine is safe when taken in  supplement form but will reduce  effects of blood pressure  medications and stimulants. So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation. Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  "}, {"claim": "Lithiumine can help make you feel calmer, improve attention span and focus, support restful sleep, protect the heart and brain, reduce blood pressure, and reduce symptoms of schizophrenia.", "sentence": "Now it can help make you feel calmer.

Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills.

Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one. Now not here to talk  about that today but I'm  wondering if you guys have ever  wondered about the effective of  lithiumine or gaba for ADHD. So  if you have drop me a yes in  the comments below. Um because  that's what I'm going to be  talking about today. Now  earlier this week someone asked  me specifically about these and  I know it's something that I've  been asked many times before.  So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea.

Now those of you who  have heard me ah before know  that what I'm getting ready to  say and I said it the other  night in my live masterclass  but for any of you new here I  want to add that you should  always start with food because  you can't supplement your way  out of a poor diet. Uh food is  always our first medicine. Uh  we go there first to try and  improve the state of the gut.  Um and the brain, the gut brain  connection and then once the  dietary changes are made that's  when I might discuss  supplementation. Or I might do  a consultation with each other.  So like at the same time you  know coming thrive can be  really good to help while we're  making those changes. So I'm  going to pop also for anyone  that's new here a link to my  free masterclass where I go  into more detail about those  dietary changes I recommend. So  be sure to check that out if  you're just getting started.  Now back to supplementation. Uh  supplementation should  definitely be tailored to each  individual in order to address  specific healing opportunities  to provide support to each  individual body. Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up. Drop  them in the comments below. I'm  always happy to help but I hope  you all have a wonderful  weekend. Take care.

You feel like there's other symptoms and other things that are might be causing but just don't know what tests to run. what I do specifically for my patients of causing certain symptoms that could be relatable to the ADHD. I grew up with it, go and hit the subscribe button. and also hit the notification bell that we do here. So real quick, I'm gonna go over my top six things that I do recommend as far as testing when you get ADHD. that could be mimicking the ADHD symptoms. So the very first one that is very common that I actually see is iron deficiency. can feel fatigued, very brain fogged, This is very symptomatic And lots cases if we actually resolve that by finding that there is a deficiency and start supplementing things with iron and also in your food base it can help improve the ADHD symptoms. is you know lead poisoning. So lead poisoning is common, it's probably not as common as you think but it definitely does happen where depending on how old your house was. ate things that had more lead in it. maybe ingested certain things just to rule out if there's a possibility, because if there is some lead poisoning it can definitely cause detriment to the brain and development, The third thing would be malnutrition. So something that you can actually check that's very common that I see with my kids is looking at malnutrition. there's different types of anemia The other thing is also vitamin D. Vitamin D can be very low especially up here in the northwest, There's also a possibility that you're not getting enough nutrients which lot of times when it comes to ADHD And if there's a lot of digestive issues those are things that should be checked, something I always check to make sure but also feed the brain which is very important when it comes to focusing and paying attention. Sometimes this can happen as where is if kids or adults have a thyroid issues Because along with having thyroid issues does cause brain fog, fatigue, having a hard time paying attention, stuff that are very similar to ADHD, And with electrolyte insufficiency usually our adrenals and our thyroid, lots of different parts of our organs rely on electrolytes, something I always like to check because that could be a possibility causing those certain symptoms but could be a thyroid, adrenal, electrolyte insufficiency situation.

Sometimes this can happen as where is if kids or adults have a thyroid issues Because along with having thyroid issues does cause brain fog, fatigue, having a hard time paying attention, stuff that are very similar to ADHD, And with electrolyte insufficiency usually our adrenals and our thyroid, lots of different parts of our organs rely on electrolytes, something I always like to check because that could be a possibility causing those certain symptoms but could be a thyroid, adrenal, electrolyte insufficiency situation.

this remedy could help you thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you're new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you're on keto and you need a debug because it's not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u.s hopefully in the future we'll be able to answer everyone's call but i put the

think that my clear skin is something genetic i struggled with acne over eight years i'm currently 20 now and i got my first acne when i was 12. ever since then i struggled so freaking much with acne and now after eight years finally i cleared my skin as you can see my skin is glowing i mean i hope so today i'll split this video into four parts we'll be talking about my acne background what did work what didn't work and how i did clear my skin everything will be time stamped down in description below so check it out and don't lose time so let's get started firstly let's talk about my acne background and let's talk about the acne type that i had and the acne type that i had according to my dermatologist was something hormonal plus caused by stressed if you don't know i'm a medical student and from my childhood i always wanted to become a doctor in my middle school i was visiting private middle school i had 50 to 75 percent off scholarship because i had so good grades and in high school i went to my dream high school which is one of the best high schools in turkey i'm not saying these to brag about my grades whatever but i from my childhood i was always stressed to get good grades i was stressing myself so freaking much because i had so high expectations for myself and i was always making myself stressed so it of course affected my skin as you can see my skin was so so freaking bad and i tried so so so many things to cure this acne that we are about to talk about if you ever searched on youtube about how to get clear skin you'll probably hear from youtubers who have a glass skin they always say drink more water exercise more change your diet etc so let's talk about those drinking more water i actually tried drinking more than two liters for six months and now the only thing that changed was the frequency that i went to toilet and the second one is changing diet i tried eating super healthy i went even vegetarian i also went vegan but those things didn't clear my skin as well third one exercising more i was exercising 30 to 6 minutes five times a week approximately doing cardio doing weight lifting and stretching yoga and a bunch of stuff however it didn't clear my skin as well i tried going to bed every single day at 9 00 pm for six months or so and i was waking up around 5 5 5 30 am ish i tried that as well but it didn't clear my skin as well after trying these fancy stuff out there i said okay there was something wrong with me i visited several dermatologists and i used their medication i use their creams i use the stuff that they give to me but nothing worked like literally nothing worked for me i couldn't find a dermatologist who was caring actually about my acne not the amount of the money i paid to them i just said okay dermatologists are not caring about my acne the only thing that take care is my money i stopped visiting my dermatologist and that day i become a skincare i tried every single product that you

effects that i had was very short term and my acne came back every time my period came one day when i was scrolling through youtube i sold a video from a japanese dermatologist tamori arata who is one of my favorite youtuber slash dermatologists out there she was telling in one of her videos that skincare is something supplementary and you cannot cure your skin problems with your skin care if you have acne you cannot completely clear it with skin care you have to go to a dermatologist and whatever they prescribe to you okay so now let's talk about how i cleared my skin is i found a super super nice dermatologist and i went to his clinic and then he looked into my skin and i talked about my acne background we decided to start a medication called accutane or isotretinoin as some people call or accutane accutane is a serious drug prescribed by dermatologists you shouldn't be using accutane if your dermatologist didn't prescribe to you you shouldn't you shouldn't because it's a very very

people give you on youtube didn't work for you then this video is for you hi guys it's me julie today i'm back with another very requested video just because i'm asian and have a clear skin a lot of people think that my clear skin is something genetic i struggled with acne over eight years i'm currently 20 now and i got my first acne when i was 12. ever since then i struggled so freaking much with acne and now after eight years finally i cleared my skin as you can see my skin is glowing i mean i hope so today i'll split this video into four parts we'll be talking about my acne background what did work what didn't work and how i did clear my skin everything will be time stamped down in description below so check it out and don't lose time so let's get started firstly let's talk about my acne background and let's talk about the acne type that i had and the acne type that i had according to my dermatologist was something hormonal plus caused by stressed if you don't know i'm a medical student and from my childhood i always wanted to become a doctor in my middle school i was visiting private middle school i had 50 to 75 percent off scholarship because i had so good grades and in high school i went to my dream high school which is one of the best high schools in turkey i'm not saying these to brag about my grades whatever but i from my childhood i was always stressed to get good grades i was stressing myself so freaking much because i had so high expectations for myself and i was always making myself stressed so it of course affected my skin as you can see my skin was so so freaking bad and i tried so so so many things to cure this acne that we are about to talk about if you ever searched on youtube about how to get clear skin you'll probably hear from youtubers who have a glass skin they always say drink more water exercise more change your diet etc so let's talk about those drinking more water i actually tried drinking more than two liters for six months and now the only thing that changed was the frequency that i went to toilet and the second one is changing diet i tried eating super healthy i went even vegetarian i also went vegan but those things didn't clear my skin as well third one exercising more i was exercising 30 to 6 minutes five times a week approximately doing cardio doing weight lifting and stretching yoga and a bunch of stuff however it didn't clear my skin as well i tried going to bed every single day at 9 00 pm for six months or so and i was waking up around 5 5 5 30 am ish i tried that as well but it didn't clear my skin as well after trying these fancy stuff out there i said okay there was something wrong with me i visited several dermatologists and i used their medication i use their creams i use the stuff that they give to me but nothing worked like literally nothing worked for me i couldn't find a dermatologist who was caring actually about my acne not the amount of the money i paid to them i just said okay dermatologists are not caring about my acne the only thing that take care is my money i stopped visiting my dermatologist and that day i become a skincare i tried every single product that you can ever imagine on market and not only in western market but also in the asian skin care market i found a lot of good products that worked for my skin but those effects were not long term all of the effects that i had was very short term and my acne came back every time my period came one day when i was scrolling through youtube i sold a video from a japanese dermatologist tamori arata who is one of my favorite youtuber slash dermatologists out there she was telling in one of her videos that skincare is something supplementary and you cannot cure your skin problems with your skin care if you have acne you cannot completely clear it with skin care you have to go to a dermatologist and whatever they prescribe to you okay so now let's talk about how i cleared my skin is i found a super super nice dermatologist and i went to his clinic and then he looked into my skin and i talked about my acne background we decided to start a medication called accutane or isotretinoin as some people call or accutane accutane is a serious drug prescribed by dermatologists you shouldn't be using accutane if your dermatologist didn't prescribe to you you shouldn't you shouldn't because it's a very very very serious drug accutane is intense here i'll put the side effects of the accutane however let me read some of the scary side effects of the actin depression headaches hair loss neurological symptoms vision problems nosebleed rapid breakdown of muscle tissue blood disease and a lot of lot of scary side effects it's very scary drug and it's pretty intense but my dermatologist said you

the last solution that you can use and let us try and here is my accutane journey accutane has different milligrams on your situation of your acne the milligram that you take differs so for me for example we started with 20 milligrams and then we increased to 40 milligrams when we started to use 40 milligrams i literally was feeling so depressed so if we decreased to 20 milligrams okay so first two months of the accutane intake is over now we're moving to the third month i think my skin got much more clearer but look at my skin like my lips are so crusty and they're all the time so freaking dry that it hurts i put a lip balm on it but it still hurts especially when i eat something spicy my lips so freaking hurts like look at those lips they look pretty weird also whenever i apply a lipstick it looks horrible so i only apply lip gloss and yeah this is my skin i think my skin looks much more better especially my acne scars i'm currently using tamanna oil i'm continuing to use it every single day i think it really helps with the scars yeah this is the end of the month to you look at this huge forehead let's talk about the mental and physical side effects of this accutane so firstly my back pain is so freaking bad i mean my back is always hurting like a grandma and i'm just like ah tired all the time i'm not really motivated but i wouldn't recommend for somebody who is going to take like a very important exam during like the exam season to take this medication because it's real like all the time like so drowsy you know like i want to sleep so bad and i just missed my bed every single minute of the day so yeah that's the effect i don't have any other side effects than the tiredness and the back pain and also whenever i do a workout my muscles hurt so much the muscle pain is also like pretty intense but you know at the end of the day your skin is getting clearer and clearer which really helps with the intake of the medication so i'm really looking forward to finish accutane and have a baby skin okay so i just entered the fourth month as you can see my skin got cleared so much but my lips are super super super crusty the thing that i don't understand is that i knew the side effects of accutane is like really crusty lips but why my upper lip especially here is getting this crusty i just don't understand it i thought my lips are here not here as you can see my lips are bleeding it hurts quite a lot and you can see my acne scars and overall i think my skin looks much more brighter and when it comes to the side effects let me say that yes when you compare the other months i'm more lethargic and i'm more sleepy but i kind of like stopped working out when you take accutane after every single workout you've done you got so sore and you couldn't move like for a couple days so i just kind of like quit running instead of that i'm walking and i'm also doing more low impact workouts here and there but most of the time i just do like random squats and random like leg lifts during my study sessions and yeah that's what i do right now i'm not really active but i think my body kind of needs to rest a little bit generally i'm pretty lethargic but you know i don't have motivation but i've never had motivation so i hope my acne scars will disappear but overall i'm pretty satisfied so i'm currently on my sixth month and as you can see i have still have like some acne scars and here i have a blemish my skin is definitely not perfect but i think it looks decent and as a mental state i'm feeling okay my lips are kind of dry a bit i mentally i don't have any problems with motivation or i don't feel depressed at all i'm super energetic and i'm super positive towards life and yeah it's the sixth month of the accutane i kinda got used to its like side effects like dry lips dry skin sensitive skin overall but i'm feeling good and the only thing that i regret is not starting accutane earlier i'm not encouraging you to start accutane i'm encouraging you to visit a dermatologist accutane is a serious drug and you should definitely visit dermatologists in order to use that don't ever start it by your own self you like visited couple dermatologists and they weren't like really caring about your skin don't give up visit another dermatologist don't like try weird methods that you sew on like youtube or on social media whatever just visit a dermatologist and ask them what you can do about your skin i hope you guys enjoyed this video i get a lot of dms about my skincare even though i said skincare will not cure your skincare

super super crusty the thing that i don't understand is that i knew the side effects of accutane is like really crusty lips but why my upper lip especially here is getting this crusty i just don't understand it i thought my lips are here not here as you can see my lips are bleeding it hurts quite a lot and you can see my acne scars and overall i think my skin looks much more brighter and when it comes to the side effects let me say that yes when you compare the other months i'm more lethargic and i'm more sleepy but i kind of like stopped working out when you take accutane after every single workout you've done you got so sore and you couldn't move like for a couple days so i just kind of like quit running instead of that i'm walking and i'm also doing more low impact workouts here and there but most of the time i just do like random squats and random like leg lifts during my study sessions and yeah that's what i do right now i'm not really active but i think my body kind of needs to rest a little bit generally i'm pretty lethargic but you know i don't have motivation but i've never had motivation so i hope my acne scars will disappear but overall i'm pretty satisfied so i'm currently on my sixth month and as you can see i have still have like some acne scars and here i have a blemish my skin is definitely not perfect but i think it looks decent and as a mental state i'm feeling okay my lips are kind of dry a bit i mentally i don't have any problems with motivation or i don't feel depressed at all i'm super energetic and i'm super positive towards life and yeah it's the sixth month of the accutane i kinda got used to its like side effects like dry lips dry skin sensitive skin overall but i'm feeling good and the only thing that i regret is not starting accutane earlier i'm not encouraging you to start accutane i'm encouraging you to visit a dermatologist accutane is a serious drug and you should definitely visit dermatologists in order to use that don't ever start it by your own self you like visited couple dermatologists and they weren't like really caring about your skin don't give up visit another dermatologist don't like try weird methods that you sew on like youtube or on social media whatever just visit a dermatologist and ask them what you can do about your skin i hope you guys enjoyed this video i get a lot of dms about my skincare

tried everything you did the healthy version of the ketogenic diet you're doing fasting right now but still it's not clearing up this acne and if you haven't tried those two things that would probably work about 90 of the time and i put a link down below of exactly what to do but i want to give you a little understanding of what's behind acne and it has to do with two main hormones primarily a spike in androgens or a spike in estrogen or a combination of both so let's go through this one by one stress induces a spike of cortisol and cortisol can increase androgens and so stress is one factor and so if it is stress you probably are going to know it and you're just going to have to do something about the stress there are a lot of things you can take there's a lot of things you can do to reduce stress okay so the next thing is that your testosterone in your body is being converted into a more powerful form of estrogen called dht and that can definitely trigger acne there's a certain enzyme that causes this conversion and low progesterone can allow this conversion to take place but normal or higher levels of progesterone can inhibit that enzyme and this is why certain people when they take progesterone get rid of their acne now what causes estrogen to be lowered in the body usually it's an increase in testosterone now i'm going to come back to estrogen in a minute but first let's talk about how to inhibit this enzyme that's making this conversion you can take saul palmetto which has been known to help acne you can also take stinging nettle root which is a good remedy or black cohosh all right now let's switch gears to estrogen and we're talking about estrogen dominance this is where you would see cystic acne but it could be other types of acne as well now we just got done talking about the enzyme that allows the conversion of testosterone to dht now let's talk about another enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen it's called aromatase so there are various natural remedies to take to lower that enzyme stinging nettle root is a good one and the reason i like that one is because it can also reduce the other enzyme that's causing that conversion to that powerful form of testosterone dht so you can kill two birds with one stone and as a side note stinging nettle root is a very powerful anti-inflammatory so if you have back pain it's something that's really powerful the second inhibitor of this enzyme is cruciferous vegetables okay so start consuming more of those and there's also something called dim which is a concentrated phytonutrient in the cruciferous vegetables that you can also take to act as a powerful inhibitor of aromatase so that's really good for cystic acne as well so one of the ways that you would know you would have this problem is you have heavy periods you have a problem with your menstrual cycle and then you just need to consume more cruciferous vegetables and definitely stinging nettle root and some dim would be very powerful as well all right there's another situation regarding estrogen dominance and that has to do with your liver your liver is naturally regulating excessive amounts of hormones especially estrogen and there are certain things in there that are creating a buffer and the most powerful remedy for the liver to handle this situation would be milk thistle not only will that help normalize estrogen but it will also increase the production of bile now if you actually even look up milk thistle in relationship to lowering pms symptoms you'll find a lot of great information so if you are aware that you have liver problems or maybe a fatty liver or you have hepatitis or you have a gut i think milk thistle will be a really good remedy to take not to mention getting on keto and especially in a minute fasting next situation is let's say you have pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome now this is a situation where you have too many androgens but that's being

So in this video, we\u2019re going to talk about the causes of acne, foods that you can avoid and some natural remedies to treat it. Acne generally occurs when the open pores of your skin are clogged with dirt, oil and bacteria. If you do not wash your face after a long day, especially if you have an oily skin type, you\u2019re going to end up clogging your pores resulting in breakouts. So it\u2019s really important to cleanse your face 2-3 times a day to prevent excess oil production and acne. Over exfoliation of the skin may also put skin\u2019s oil production into overdrive. Scrub your face once or twice a week to keep your skin healthy and radiant. When the bacteria on the surface of the phone comes in contact with our skin, this aggravates the skin leading to acne and breakouts. So clean your screens whenever you get the chance. It\u2019s time to look at what you\u2019re putting inside your body that\u2019s causing the flare up. The worst offenders are sugar, caffeine, refined carbohydrates. Avoid going overboard with fried and processed baked foods that are enemies of the body as well as your skin. Sometimes people who consume a lot of dairy in terms of milk, ice creams, etc also suffer from acne. Chocolates are known to reactivate acne causing bacteria in the body. Eat plenty of skin and heart friendly nuts and seeds that are high in omega 3 fatty acids and zinc.

This decadent mask will not only make your skin glow but also exfoliate and eliminate acne. Mix 2 tsp of fine coffee, 1 tbsp cocoa powder, \u00bd tsp cinnamon powder and 1 tsp honey. The antioxidants and stimulants present in coffee reduce skin inflammation and unclog pores. Cocoa powder detoxifies the skin, cinnamon fights acne. Honey on the other hand has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties. Add some water or rose water to the mix and apply on your face. This mask revives and brightens dull skin in no time. If your skin is producing excess oils and you\u2019re fearing a massive acne eruption on your face, give this DIY a try. You want to start by taking 2 tsp of besan, 1 teaspoon multani mitti and 3 tbsp rose water. Mix them and apply. Leave it on for 20 minutes and then rinse.

compress for 20 minutes at a time four times a day and in between the warm compress see if you can fit in these natural remedies that i'm about to tell you let's get straight into it and start with the first one being tea tree oil the reason why is because tea tree oil has strong antibacterial and antiseptic properties and remember it's bacteria that infect and then inflame the hair follicles which ends up causing boils the cyclic monoterpenes in the tea tree oil exhibit what's known as broad spectrum anti-microbial activity related back to terpene for all because the water soluble components of tea tree oil they suppress pro-inflammatory mediated productions of monocytes this is actually why tea tree oil is used in athlete's foot nail fungus and lice but the tricky part is if you've tried this you may have noticed it burning a little bit so to really get the most out of it mix it you want to mix five drops of tea tree oil with a teaspoon of coconut oil once it's all mixed in apply it on a cotton swab and then apply it on the boil twice a day until you see results let's go on to the second option which is turmeric powder like tea tree oil turmeric powder also has anti-microbial and anti-bacterial properties the yellow component known as curcumin is what's most likely going to work the most here its anti-inflammatory properties are mediated through its ability to stop cyclooxogenase ii lipoxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase if you stop these inflammatory processes from occurring you theoretically get less inflammation and help speed up getting rid of that boil so to start i recommend to pound a small amount of ginger in a mortar and pestle until it's smooth then mix in the turmeric to form a paste then you can apply the mixture to the boil

tea tree oil with a teaspoon of coconut oil once it's all mixed in apply it on a cotton swab and then apply it on the boil twice a day until you see results let's go on to the second option which is turmeric powder like tea tree oil turmeric powder also has anti-microbial and anti-bacterial properties the yellow component known as curcumin is what's most likely going to work the most here its anti-inflammatory properties are mediated through its ability to stop cyclooxogenase ii lipoxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase if you stop these inflammatory processes from occurring you theoretically get less inflammation and help speed up getting rid of that boil so to start i recommend to pound a small amount of ginger in a mortar and pestle until it's smooth then mix in the turmeric to form a paste then you can apply the mixture to the boil twice a day until it's gone one thing here is that turmeric will temporarily color your skin an orangey yellow color but hey it's
