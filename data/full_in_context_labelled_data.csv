Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one. Now not here to talk  about that today but I'm  wondering if you guys have ever  wondered about the effective of  lithiumine or gaba for ADHD. So  if you have drop me a yes in  the comments below. Um because  that's what I'm going to be  talking about today. Now  earlier this week someone asked  me specifically about these and  I know it's something that I've  been asked many times before.  So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea. Now lit  theanine is safe when taken in  supplement form but will reduce  effects of blood pressure  medications and stimulants. So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation. Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  ",understandable,promotion,treatment/cure,can't tell,harmless,not worth checking

Functional lab testing can help target supplementation for children with ADHD.,"w or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  quickly. Now those of you who  have heard me ah before know  that what I'm getting ready to  say and I said it the other  night in my live masterclass  but for any of you new here I  want to add that you should  always start with food because  you can't supplement your way  out of a poor diet. Uh food is  always our first medicine. Uh  we go there first to try and  improve the state of the gut.  Um and the brain, the gut brain  connection and then once the  dietary changes are made that's  when I might discuss  supplementation. Or I might do  a consultation with each other.  So like at the same time you  know coming thrive can be  really good to help while we're  making those changes. So I'm  going to pop also for anyone  that's new here a link to my  free masterclass where I go  into more detail about those  dietary changes I recommend. So  be sure to check that out if  you're just getting started.  Now back to supplementation. Uh  supplementation should  definitely be tailored to each  individual in order to address  specific healing opportunities  to provide support to each  individual body. Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up. Drop  them in the comments below. I'm  always happy to help but I hope  you all have a wonderful  weekend. Take care.  ",vague,hedged claim,treatment/cure,can't tell,harmless,not worth checking

The supplement Calming Thrive contains both GABA and lithiumine and comes in an easy-to-use liquid form.,"Hello, hello, hello, everyone.  Happy Friday. Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one. Now not here to talk  about that today but I'm  wondering if you guys have ever  wondered about the effective of  lithiumine or gaba for ADHD. So  if you have drop me a yes in  the comments below. Um because  that's what I'm going to be  talking about today. Now  earlier this week someone asked  me specifically about these and  I know it's something that I've  been asked many times before.  So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea. Now lit  theanine is safe when taken in  supplement form but will reduce  effects of blood pressure  medications and stimulants. So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation. Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  ",understandable,statement of fact,treatment/cure,can't tell,harmless,not worth checking
Every child with ADHD is different and requires a tailored approach to treatment.,"w or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  quickly. Now those of you who  have heard me ah before know  that what I'm getting ready to  say and I said it the other  night in my live masterclass  but for any of you new here I  want to add that you should  always start with food because  you can't supplement your way  out of a poor diet. Uh food is  always our first medicine. Uh  we go there first to try and  improve the state of the gut.  Um and the brain, the gut brain  connection and then once the  dietary changes are made that's  when I might discuss  supplementation. Or I might do  a consultation with each other.  So like at the same time you  know coming thrive can be  really good to help while we're  making those changes. So I'm  going to pop also for anyone  that's new here a link to my  free masterclass where I go  into more detail about those  dietary changes I recommend. So  be sure to check that out if  you're just getting started.  Now back to supplementation. Uh  supplementation should  definitely be tailored to each  individual in order to address  specific healing opportunities  to provide support to each  individual body. Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up. Drop  them in the comments below. I'm  always happy to help but I hope  you all have a wonderful  weekend. Take care.

A tiny bit of vinegar on a green leafy salad can help our digestive systems absorb more calcium from the leaves than we would naturally.,okay Down the Hatch oh I hope this [Music] works hey there Health nuts and internet crazers Trace here for D news there are broad claims regarding the efficacy of apple cider vinegar power to curb appetite burn fat cure rashes stop heartburn bring down fever and cure asthma treat wounds reduce effects of aging and even cure diseases like cancer is this a miracal drug no it's not but that doesn't mean it's bunk vinegar is a derivative of alcoholic beverages to make their bottled Delights wine makers ferment grapes with yeast the yeast eat sugar from the grapes and poop out alcohol and CO2 yum to make vinegar is the same but acetab actor bacteria is added to Wine the bacteria eats the alcohol and then poops out acetic acid acetic acid is what makes vinegar vinegar the word vinegar comes from French for sour wine although it can be made from wine beer rice or other fermentables like wood apple cider vinegar is made with you guessed it double fermented apple cider apples to Hard Cider to apple cider vinegar personal note why'd y'all mess up a good thing according to the USDA apple cider vinegar contains none of the vitamins a B6 c e or K and no nasin riboflavin thamin penic acid or folate what it does contain according to the FDA is a minimum of 4% of acetic acid and a lot of water this means vinegar or acetic acid likely won't make you thinner and there is no scientific support of it as a skin toner and when Medscape general medicine conducted a review of all the research on vinegar they found that it was not recommended as an anti-infectious medicine orally or topically more like on your surface and probably doesn't fight hypertension and in terms of its cancer fighting claims while it did shrink leukemia cells and tumors in lab experiments that effect has not been shown in humans at all now a 2015 study in plus one did find small concentrations of acetic acid can help reduce bacterial growth on surfaces and Pub cam lists acetic acid as having mild antibacterial and antifungal properties this is why vinegar can be used as a mild household cleanser but putting vinegar on your face is probably not the best idea pimples are bacterial infections of the cious gland so it might decrease bacterial load there however it's not recommended by any real scientific research though I did find a 1916 book for nurses that recommended vinegar as a treat for acne but it also advised putting Mercury on your face drinking vinegar was studied way more often than using it as an antibacterial Aid acids are known boosters of mineral absorption so a tiny bit of vinegar on a green leafy salad can help our digestive systems absorb more calcium from the leaves than we would naturally and a 2004 study of 11 people with type 2 diabetes found when participants consumed a tiny bit of vinegar they had higher sensitivity to insulin which is a good thing and though this study was too small to generalize to All Humans research is ongoing and it is really positive the thing is don't drink too much vinegar vinegar is an acid and will damage the throat and stomach lining and also erode the teeth there is a reason it is diluted and speaking of diluted if you leave vinegar alone that same bacteria that fermented the alcohol to turn it into vinegar will eventually grow into a massive colony which some call a mother yeah aactor bacteria grows into kombucha eventually so there you go crunchy greeny Birkenstock wearers go be friends but if you're interested in drinking the pre-made apple cider vinegar derivative kombucha maybe you should learn more about what that is first in this video Kombucha tea has been popular with holistic health proponents for decades likely branching from centuries old Asian medicine if you've never seen it before modern Kombucha Tea comes from a strange looking container of brownish liquid with a blob floating in it have you tried apple cider vinegar are you against it are you for it tell us in the comments or come find me over on Twitter I'm @ Trace Dominguez make sure you subscribe see you next time on D [Music] news ,understandable,statement of fact,cause/effect,can't tell,harmless,not worth checking

By optimizing the functioning of the basal ganglia things such as fear and anxiety can be decreased while at the same time things such as motivation and energy levels can be increased.,if three activities could help your anxiety improve your mental health and health in general would you be interested I will be discussing three natural remedies in this video the first item I want to discuss is exercise exercise promotes the release of brain chemicals that are very good for you dr. John Ratey describes exercise as a fertilizer to help our cells function optimally including brain cells exercise promotes neurogenesis which helps the brain grow new brain cells it helps you generate endorphins the body's feel-good chemicals which can help you feel a sense of well-being researchers at the Shante University Medicine who completed an experiment with panic attack sufferers concluded the following our results for the first time suggest that exercise has acute anti panic attack activity best of all you can get started today with something as simple as walking another natural remedy is proper eating dr. Daniel Amen explains that by optimizing the functioning of the basal ganglia things such as fear and anxiety can be decreased while at the same time things such as motivation and energy levels can be increased you can optimize by keeping your blood sugar levels consistent throughout the day in three ways by consuming one foods lower in carbohydrates than the typical Western diet two foods lower in glycemic love this term refers to how quickly a typical portion of a particular food raises your blood sugar you can easily find the glycemic rating of different foods by completing an internet search and then building a diet that favors this approach and finally for consuming food more frequently throughout the day but in lesser quantities another important item is proper sleep the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School indicated studies have shown that even partial sleep deprivation has a significant effect on mood lack of sleep can't elevate the body's production of stress hormones which can affect mood and even cause depression however addressing these sleep problems makes a difference and even if you don't have underlying sleep problems taking the following steps can ensure you obtain adequate sleep and lead to improved mood and well-being ensure you don't have too much noise in your room where you sleep if noise is an unavoidable problem consider getting a white noise machine or a small fan that runs in the background ensure that your room is not too hot a cool temperature is best for sleeping if you wake in the night don't turn on the lights rather use a flashlight this is because light affects a brain chemical called melatonin which regulates your sleep-wake cycle would you like more information on the topics covered in this video all you need to do is simply click on the card on the upper right corner of this video and subscribe to our free newsletter thank you for watching as usual we look forward to presenting a new video in our series next week you ,understandable,hedged claim,cause/effect,novel claim,harmless,not worth checking

Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up. Drop  them in the comments below. I'm  always happy to help but I hope  you all have a wonderful  weekend. Take care.  ",vague,hedged claim,treatment/cure,can't tell,indirect harm,not worth checking

Researchers at the Shante University Medicine who completed an experiment with panic attack sufferers concluded the following our results for the first time suggest that exercise has acute anti panic attack activity.,if three activities could help your anxiety improve your mental health and health in general would you be interested I will be discussing three natural remedies in this video the first item I want to discuss is exercise exercise promotes the release of brain chemicals that are very good for you dr. John Ratey describes exercise as a fertilizer to help our cells function optimally including brain cells exercise promotes neurogenesis which helps the brain grow new brain cells it helps you generate endorphins the body's feel-good chemicals which can help you feel a sense of well-being researchers at the Shante University Medicine who completed an experiment with panic attack sufferers concluded the following our results for the first time suggest that exercise has acute anti panic attack activity best of all you can get started today with something as simple as walking another natural remedy is proper eating dr. Daniel Amen explains that by optimizing the functioning of the basal ganglia things such as fear and anxiety can be decreased while at the same time things such as motivation and energy levels can be increased you can optimize by keeping your blood sugar levels consistent throughout the day in three ways by consuming one foods lower in carbohydrates than the typical Western diet two foods lower in glycemic love this term refers to how quickly a typical portion of a particular food raises your blood sugar you can easily find the glycemic rating of different foods by completing an internet search and then building a diet that favors this approach and finally for consuming food more frequently throughout the day but in lesser quantities another important item is proper sleep the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School indicated studies have shown that even partial sleep deprivation has a significant effect on mood lack of sleep can't elevate the body's production of stress hormones which can affect mood and even cause depression however addressing these sleep problems makes a difference and even if you don't have underlying sleep problems taking the following steps can ensure you obtain adequate sleep and lead to improved mood and well-being ensure you don't have too much noise in your room where you sleep if noise is an unavoidable problem consider getting a white noise machine or a small fan that runs in the background ensure that your room is not too hot a cool temperature is best for sleeping if you wake in the night don't turn on the lights rather use a flashlight this is because light affects a brain chemical called melatonin which regulates your sleep-wake cycle would you like more information on the topics covered in this video all you need to do is simply click on the card on the upper right corner of this video and subscribe to our free newsletter thank you for watching as usual we look forward to presenting a new video in our series next week you ,understandable,citation,cause/effect,novel claim,harmless,not worth checking

HPV can cause some serious health problems which could include genital warts or a variety of different Cancers,human papilloma virus or commonly abbreviated HPV is a family of different viruses that has more than 200 different strains however the strains that are most common for causing some serious infections really is just about two now this HPV is the most common STI in the United States and it is transmitted through sexual contact or very close skin to skin contact now HPV can cause some serious health problems which could include genital warts or a variety of different Cancers and the way that it works when causing cancer is that HPV can actually enter our human cells and then it can cause some disruption in the communication between the cell and its neighbors so typically cells will communicate with each other through different signaling Pathways but when those different signaling Pathways get disrupted messages can get confused and that can cause the cell that has now been infected with HPV to start growing uncontrollably which can be known as a tumor or a Cancer and we'll talk more soon about how we can prevent these different types of HPV infections through vaccination ,understandable,hedged claim,cause/effect,uncontroversial statement,low harm,not worth checking
"Studies show that individuals recovering from anorexia exhibit different brain activity patterns in the insula, a region associated with taste perception. This suggests that they may experience taste differently and have reduced motivation to eat, potentially contributing to their eating disorder.",there's also evidence that other brain regions show different patterns of activity in patients recovering from anorexia in a region called the insula the insula is a part of the cortex that helps the brain identify what it's tasting along with other brain regions like the amydala and the orbital frontal cortex the insula helps us identify what tastes we like and don't like more activity is seen in these when we're hungry and less when we're full these brain areas along with vental striatum help determine how motivated we are by food when individuals with normal eating patterns are given a sweet tasting stimulus during brain Imaging there's a lot of activity seen in the insula the more they report liking sugar the more activity in the insula on the other hand patients who are recovering from anorexia show lower levels of activity in the insula which might indicate that they find the sugary taste less pleasurable than their control counterparts these individuals appear to actually experience taste differently even after recovery scientists interpret this as indicating that people who suffer from anorexia are less driven by hunger and appetite signals than usual and with less motivation to eat it may be easier for these individuals to drive themselves to the edge of starvation,understandable,hedged claim,correlation,can't tell,low harm,may be worth checking

"Lithiumine can help make you feel calmer, improve attention span and focus, support restful sleep, protect the heart and brain, reduce blood pressure, and reduce symptoms of schizophrenia.","Hello, hello, hello, everyone.  Happy Friday. Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one. Now not here to talk  about that today but I'm  wondering if you guys have ever  wondered about the effective of  lithiumine or gaba for ADHD. So  if you have drop me a yes in  the comments below. Um because  that's what I'm going to be  talking about today. Now  earlier this week someone asked  me specifically about these and  I know it's something that I've  been asked many times before.  So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea. Now lit  theanine is safe when taken in  supplement form but will reduce  effects of blood pressure  medications and stimulants. So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation. Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  ",understandable,hedged claim,treatment/cure,can't tell,low harm,may be worth checking

Food is critical for children with ADHD.,"w or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  quickly. Now those of you who  have heard me ah before know  that what I'm getting ready to  say and I said it the other  night in my live masterclass  but for any of you new here I  want to add that you should  always start with food because  you can't supplement your way  out of a poor diet. Uh food is  always our first medicine. Uh  we go there first to try and  improve the state of the gut.  Um and the brain, the gut brain  connection and then once the  dietary changes are made that's  when I might discuss  supplementation. Or I might do  a consultation with each other.  So like at the same time you  know coming thrive can be  really good to help while we're  making those changes. So I'm  going to pop also for anyone  that's new here a link to my  free masterclass where I go  into more detail about those  dietary changes I recommend. So  be sure to check that out if  you're just getting started.  Now back to supplementation. Uh  supplementation should  definitely be tailored to each  individual in order to address  specific healing opportunities  to provide support to each  individual body. Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up. Drop  them in the comments below. I'm  always happy to help but I hope  you all have a wonderful  weekend. Take care.

Synthetic food colorings and preservatives can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD.,"Hello, I'm Gina Van Luven with Healthy Healing TV. Today, we're gonna be talking about natural remedies for ADHD. Having a son who once had ADHD, I know how challenging it can be for everyone involved. Unfortunately, medication just masks the symptoms and can actually cause more problems. In fact, prescription medication can cause the need for additional medication which is not so much fun either. Natural remedies, however, help to bring the body back into balance again. They provide what the body needs so that it can function optimally. Today, I'm going to share with you six natural remedies for ADHD. Number 1 is to avoid synthetic food colorings and preservatives. The European Union actually recognizes that these synthetic ingredients can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD and they require special labeling for products containing them. Number 2... do a heavy metal detoxification. Now, if you're not sure what detoxification experiencing ADHD symptoms. Heavy metals like lead and mercury in particular, can really wreak havoc on the brain and cause symptoms of ADHD along with other behavioral issues. Using natural key leaders like cilantro, chlorella, chlorophyll, zeolite, bentonite... there's Number 3... have an IgG, IgA, IgE food sensitivity tests done. And if you're not sure what that any type of food sensitivities. you're removing any specific foods, it's really important that you do that for a long period of time - several months, or you're not going to experience the results that you're looking for. eliminated very consistently from day to day over several months. Number 4... supplementing with the following nutrients can provide your body with what it needs to function optimally. Minerals like calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Magnesium in particular is very helpful at helping overcome ADHD symptoms. I actually prefer magnesium oil and rubbing it on the feet. the RDA or recommended daily allowance isn't enough to increase your levels.

"Overweight and obese people tend to have more body fat, including toxic fat that accumulates around organs. These toxins can disrupt the immune system, leading to the production of circulating immune complexes (CICs). CICs can clog up the bloodstream, making it difficult for immune cells to reach areas where they are needed, similar to a traffic jam on a highway.",bigger people also tend to carry more body fat and also more toxic fat around their organs these toxins again can create a problem and and increase the production of what we call circulating immune cells of CICS so circulating immune cells are basically bits of pollen or antibody antigen complexes dead cells in a spin cells busted down Candida for example or byproducts of bacteria these toxins tend to clog up the immune system again it's like a traffic jam basically it's a highway jammed up so your blood stream is basically like a large expressway a lot of things travel up and down you know these various arteries but if it starts getting jammed up with CICS again you're having a problem with immune cells going to certain spots you know the police can't get to you know a failure of near fatal road accident if there's 500 cars all banged up so you can see the complexities here,understandable,statement of fact,cause/effect,novel claim,can't tell,not worth checking

GABA and lithium can be a great support to children with ADHD.,"w or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  quickly. Now those of you who  have heard me ah before know  that what I'm getting ready to  say and I said it the other  night in my live masterclass  but for any of you new here I  want to add that you should  always start with food because  you can't supplement your way  out of a poor diet. Uh food is  always our first medicine. Uh  we go there first to try and  improve the state of the gut.  Um and the brain, the gut brain  connection and then once the  dietary changes are made that's  when I might discuss  supplementation. Or I might do  a consultation with each other.  So like at the same time you  know coming thrive can be  really good to help while we're  making those changes. So I'm  going to pop also for anyone  that's new here a link to my  free masterclass where I go  into more detail about those  dietary changes I recommend. So  be sure to check that out if  you're just getting started.  Now back to supplementation. Uh  supplementation should  definitely be tailored to each  individual in order to address  specific healing opportunities  to provide support to each  individual body. Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up. Drop  them in the comments below. I'm  always happy to help but I hope  you all have a wonderful  weekend. Take care.

"Iron deficiency can cause fatigue and brain fog, which are symptoms of ADHD.","- Do you feel like with ADHD, was just not enough? You feel like there's other symptoms and other things that are might be causing but just don't know what tests to run. what I do specifically for my patients of causing certain symptoms that could be relatable to the ADHD. I grew up with it, go and hit the subscribe button. and also hit the notification bell that we do here. So real quick, I'm gonna go over my top six things that I do recommend as far as testing when you get ADHD. that could be mimicking the ADHD symptoms. So the very first one that is very common that I actually see is iron deficiency. can feel fatigued, very brain fogged, This is very symptomatic And lots cases if we actually resolve that by finding that there is a deficiency and start supplementing things with iron and also in your food base it can help improve the ADHD symptoms. is you know lead poisoning. So lead poisoning is common, it's probably not as common as you think but it definitely does happen where depending on how old your house was. ate things that had more lead in it. maybe ingested certain things just to rule out if there's a possibility, because if there is some lead poisoning it can definitely cause detriment to the brain and development, The third thing would be malnutrition. So something that you can actually check that's very common that I see with my kids is looking at malnutrition. there's different types of anemia The other thing is also vitamin D. Vitamin D can be very low especially up here in the northwest, There's also a possibility that you're not getting enough nutrients which lot of times when it comes to ADHD And if there's a lot of digestive issues those are things that should be checked, something I always check to make sure but also feed the brain which is very important when it comes to focusing and paying attention. Sometimes this can happen as where is if kids or adults have a thyroid issues Because along with having thyroid issues does cause brain fog, fatigue, having a hard time paying attention, stuff that are very similar to ADHD, And with electrolyte insufficiency usually our adrenals and our thyroid, lots of different parts of our organs rely on electrolytes, something I always like to check because that could be a possibility causing those certain symptoms but could be a thyroid, adrenal, electrolyte insufficiency situation. The fifth thing that I would suggest looking at IgE. it also could be done through bloodwork. But another thing that you could do is a food elimination diet.

Lead poisoning can damage the brain and cause ADHD-like symptoms.,"- Do you feel like with ADHD, was just not enough? You feel like there's other symptoms and other things that are might be causing but just don't know what tests to run. what I do specifically for my patients of causing certain symptoms that could be relatable to the ADHD. I grew up with it, go and hit the subscribe button. and also hit the notification bell that we do here. So real quick, I'm gonna go over my top six things that I do recommend as far as testing when you get ADHD. that could be mimicking the ADHD symptoms. So the very first one that is very common that I actually see is iron deficiency. can feel fatigued, very brain fogged, This is very symptomatic And lots cases if we actually resolve that by finding that there is a deficiency and start supplementing things with iron and also in your food base it can help improve the ADHD symptoms. is you know lead poisoning. So lead poisoning is common, it's probably not as common as you think but it definitely does happen where depending on how old your house was. ate things that had more lead in it. maybe ingested certain things just to rule out if there's a possibility, because if there is some lead poisoning it can definitely cause detriment to the brain and development, The third thing would be malnutrition. So something that you can actually check that's very common that I see with my kids is looking at malnutrition. there's different types of anemia The other thing is also vitamin D. Vitamin D can be very low especially up here in the northwest, There's also a possibility that you're not getting enough nutrients which lot of times when it comes to ADHD And if there's a lot of digestive issues those are things that should be checked, something I always check to make sure but also feed the brain which is very important when it comes to focusing and paying attention. Sometimes this can happen as where is if kids or adults have a thyroid issues Because along with having thyroid issues does cause brain fog, fatigue, having a hard time paying attention, stuff that are very similar to ADHD, And with electrolyte insufficiency usually our adrenals and our thyroid, lots of different parts of our organs rely on electrolytes, something I always like to check because that could be a possibility causing those certain symptoms but could be a thyroid, adrenal, electrolyte insufficiency situation. The fifth thing that I would suggest looking at IgE. it also could be done through bloodwork. But another thing that you could do is a food elimination diet.

Heavy metals like lead and mercury can cause symptoms of ADHD along with other behavioral issues.,"Hello, I'm Gina Van Luven with Healthy Healing TV. Today, we're gonna be talking about natural remedies for ADHD. Having a son who once had ADHD, I know how challenging it can be for everyone involved. Unfortunately, medication just masks the symptoms and can actually cause more problems. In fact, prescription medication can cause the need for additional medication which is not so much fun either. Natural remedies, however, help to bring the body back into balance again. They provide what the body needs so that it can function optimally. Today, I'm going to share with you six natural remedies for ADHD. Number 1 is to avoid synthetic food colorings and preservatives. The European Union actually recognizes that these synthetic ingredients can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD and they require special labeling for products containing them. Number 2... do a heavy metal detoxification. Now, if you're not sure what detoxification experiencing ADHD symptoms. Heavy metals like lead and mercury in particular, can really wreak havoc on the brain and cause symptoms of ADHD along with other behavioral issues. Using natural key leaders like cilantro, chlorella, chlorophyll, zeolite, bentonite... there's Number 3... have an IgG, IgA, IgE food sensitivity tests done. And if you're not sure what that any type of food sensitivities. you're removing any specific foods, it's really important that you do that for a long period of time - several months, or you're not going to experience the results that you're looking for. eliminated very consistently from day to day over several months. Number 4... supplementing with the following nutrients can provide your body with what it needs to function optimally. Minerals like calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Magnesium in particular is very helpful at helping overcome ADHD symptoms. I actually prefer magnesium oil and rubbing it on the feet. the RDA or recommended daily allowance isn't enough to increase your levels. So 5 to 10,000 international units which are IUs a day is appropriate to bring your levels L-glutamine in particular is really considered brain fuel and is great for people that are suffering from ADHD. Number 5... implement relaxation techniques in the morning and before bed. Number 6... avoid electronics before going to bed. This actually revs up the brain and By eliminating the harmful things and providing your body what it needs, ADHD symptoms can simply disappear.

"By eliminating the harmful things and providing your body what it needs, ADHD symptoms can simply disappear.","Hello, I'm Gina Van Luven with Healthy Healing TV. Today, we're gonna be talking about natural remedies for ADHD. Having a son who once had ADHD, I know how challenging it can be for everyone involved. Unfortunately, medication just masks the symptoms and can actually cause more problems. In fact, prescription medication can cause the need for additional medication which is not so much fun either. Natural remedies, however, help to bring the body back into balance again. They provide what the body needs so that it can function optimally. Today, I'm going to share with you six natural remedies for ADHD. Number 1 is to avoid synthetic food colorings and preservatives. The European Union actually recognizes that these synthetic ingredients can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD and they require special labeling for products containing them. Number 2... do a heavy metal detoxification. Now, if you're not sure what detoxification experiencing ADHD symptoms. Heavy metals like lead and mercury in particular, can really wreak havoc on the brain and cause symptoms of ADHD along with other behavioral issues. Using natural key leaders like cilantro, chlorella, chlorophyll, zeolite, bentonite... there's Number 3... have an IgG, IgA, IgE food sensitivity tests done. And if you're not sure what that any type of food sensitivities. you're removing any specific foods, it's really important that you do that for a long period of time - several months, or you're not going to experience the results that you're looking for. eliminated very consistently from day to day over several months. Number 4... supplementing with the following nutrients can provide your body with what it needs to function optimally. Minerals like calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Magnesium in particular is very helpful at helping overcome ADHD symptoms. I actually prefer magnesium oil and rubbing it on the feet. the RDA or recommended daily allowance isn't enough to increase your levels. So 5 to 10,000 international units which are IUs a day is appropriate to bring your levels L-glutamine in particular is really considered brain fuel and is great for people that are suffering from ADHD. Number 5... implement relaxation techniques in the morning and before bed. Number 6... avoid electronics before going to bed. This actually revs up the brain and By eliminating the harmful things and providing your body what it needs, ADHD symptoms can simply disappear.

So there's three trees that are meant to be associated with those. So the hawthorns, the one meant to be associated with the maiden. - Interesting. Yeah. And what were you saying about ogham as well? between the, the stages of womanhood which I'm sure there's people in the room who know more about it than I do, of legend and mythology surrounding it. Oh - Yeah. The folklore associated with trees is, is, yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it? and I, I kind of, again, I quite look, used to, if they burned elder I think it's full of cyanide. And if you burned elder, of folklore with the elder tree. Yeah. But my, I think my, my top two would be birch and Hawthorne. Yeah. Lovely. Definitely. Yeah. - Okay. And then just the last question before we have the last reading is, are you working on something else? - Yes. Yes. In fact, one which is for the reader to So noticing particular species and much more recent research. 'cause this, this book was written into the pathways that are activated when we interact with nature. if you saw your wild orchid and how doing those kinds I talk a lot about the flow state because we have this endocannabinoid that's released called anandamide. If you are crocheting a mitten or you are going out into a wood and looking for particular species, yeah, it doesn't matter if it looks like your dog drew, it doesn't matter. And this anandamide, this elusive anandamide will be released, which is called the bliss, bliss chemical. And it binds the same receptor as the active component of can cannabis. of berries and don't eat the berries. I'm not talking about dodgy berries. I mean, I mean, just go Get into this flow state. in the new book is triggered by kind repetitive movements of hand and eye that we get into when we're doing what we now call craft. of middle class treat, don't we? We, we, well oh, oh, I put myself, I've put myself on a workshop. We shouldn't see it as a treat. We should be doing those things and give us this brilliant cannabinoid that we make ourselves. that we are in, we are walking around with a massive dopamine deficit. God knows what lived down the road. and stealing your wild boar. Yes. Stressful. And also extremely Duffy. We were like living till about 35 And it was really hard to make you enough. And you had to keep your toddlers warm getting this our dinner, which was frankly sparse and god awful. But we were happy. Sorry. No, no, that's, that's very simplified. of mental illness, the pre the high, terribly high prevalence of depression and anxiety in modern humans Hands up who's had either Yeah. pretty much everyone else. Yeah. It's because we are walking around we were, we evolved. And we're not doing it because of Tesco and we're not doing it. middle class guilt. No, I mustn't put myself on a workshop. crochet cro or do whatever craft It's what we were built for. And we are walking around with not enough positive neurotransmitters - Of course. Absolutely. I just noticed there's a dog. - Yeah, we have a dog here. And is, I just wanted Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. So has anyone got a question for Emma? - Hi. I've got a question that's really from slightly controversial, but I have some really bad hay fever. between acute hay fever and suicide rates and depression. Wow. for over a century. Oh. And they used to think it was because people felt a bit sorry for themselves if they had hay fever. of worked out that it's because people And it's to do with how we process things in the olf factory region of the brain. with schizophrenia, 50% as well in many, many cases. 'cause I'm really interested in it and because I have lots of allergies. And so for me, I, my, Oh, lovely. And like the coast is fine. Salt out all good. That's it. if you are sheltering in your house, potentially in the spring pollen and things and there's loads of it, then you're not kept coming into contact with the green spaces as much. So that's, that's my first thought. That's a brilliant hack. and that's diminished, of course it is. It makes sense, doesn't it? smell really pleasant things. by which nature improves our mood but actually it's a group term for all the oils produced by plants.

Broccoli sprout extract has been shown to reduce many of the symptoms of autism in about half of the subjects compared to placebos.,at was that was sort of that was what got the collaboration started so we supplied broccoli sprout extract and and they up in in Boston looked at I guess it was about 44 subjects all men all young men boys men as you probably know autism is about four to one male to female in terms of its incidents in this country anyway and less than or more than one and a hundred kids now are born with autism so it's it's it's a huge problem I don't need to go into detail about why it's such a big problem but because they're because you're an expert on autism among other things oh really but we've studied it yeah so at any rate we did this trial it was published in 2014 we for various reasons biomarkers of inflammation of the nrf2 pathway and a heat shock response were not evaluated in blood from those subjects but what we showed was rather dramatic reduction in many of the symptoms of autism in about half of the subjects compared to placebos those who were given placebo instead of broccoli sprout extract in which there was no detectable change I think it was like a 37% yeah it was very very robust for a small amount it was dramatic they were right that n was small the number of subjects was small but it was a dramatic improvement I am so sad that we never got the biomarker data from the subjects although theoretically it's still available as a result of that trial a lot of people got interested in the possibilities and so dr. Zimmerman and his team including including the Coleman chemo Protection Centre here have a follow up grant from the Department of Defense to study a younger cohort male and female boys and girls about 50 subjects but a similar trial design and it is going to be but it is biomarker rich so we've already done a pilot study with 10 subjects in which we evaluated we refined our ability to collect samples and to process the biomarker samples will be we were collecting blood from all of them and this is a trial design where half of them half of the subjects are getting actually a v' McCall one of them one of the supplements the dietary supplements the one with with glucoraphanin and my Ronnie's half of them are getting that half of them are getting a placebo for I think it's 15 weeks for but for about the same amount of time as we gave subjects in the previous trial biomarker rich there's a washout period and then and then everybody goes on a bra the the sulforaphane product the AB McCall for another 15 weeks we're doctor hua lu and i she's doing most of the biomarker work here at Hopkins she and I were just up in Worcester Massachusetts the team is now at UMass Medical Center in Worcester Massachusetts there they've processed about 1/3 of the subjects so we're about a third of the way through completing the trial and we're very excited obviously about about what we may find and about getting to the task of processing these biomarkers very exciting and what was a dose difference from the first trial the first trial the dose of well it's a little complicated but if you bear with me the first trial delivered sulforaphane rich broccoli sprout extract okay remember that's 70% bioavailable okay those trials delivering glucoraphanin plus myrosinase it's calibrated to be to deliver about the same amount as the previous trial so the between a hundred and 150 micro moles per subject per day is there a reason why you're not doing a dose response or doing trying higher doses as well to see if there was a more robust effect the next trial will okay so that is that's my blind well it's in the it's in yeah yeah so I mean look after a tile like this especially one where we were not able to publish biomarker results there are many people saying wow that's really interesting but it's got to be repeated so we and others are trying to repeat it just essentially as closely as possible to the way it was designed right yeah it does make sense and it's unfortunate if these trials weren't so damned expensive I mean try all it's very very exciting it's it's exciting but it's very expensive it's labor intensive and and it also you're you know you've got the hopes and fears and desires and tears of a lot of people involved these are these are conditions that that you know that that hurt to see people going through and so to do a whole bunch of trials with a whole bunch of conditions might also make the people who are suffering from these conditions really think that you know this is that that we already have the answer this is why I'm so afraid of some of the cancer prevention trials that are being done you know people people get on their high horse and that don't know what they're talking about I think you know again one of the most frequently heard things for me is Oh John's hot scientists at Johns Hopkins say this this cures cancer I mean I've heard that said about so many things not just certainly not just our work it ain't true mrit to be true but same thing with autism that if we if I guess if it were cheap and easy to do and nobody cared about the subjects ,understandable,citation,treatment/cure,novel claim,high harm,worth checking
