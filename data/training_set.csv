"Lithiumine can help make you feel calmer, improve attention span and focus, support restful sleep, protect the heart and brain, reduce blood pressure, and reduce symptoms of schizophrenia.","Hello, hello, hello, everyone.  Happy Friday. Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one. Now not here to talk  about that today but I'm  wondering if you guys have ever  wondered about the effective of  lithiumine or gaba for ADHD. So  if you have drop me a yes in  the comments below. Um because  that's what I'm going to be  talking about today. Now  earlier this week someone asked  me specifically about these and  I know it's something that I've  been asked many times before.  So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea. Now lit  theanine is safe when taken in  supplement form but will reduce  effects of blood pressure  medications and stimulants. So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation. Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  ",FALSE

So I really wanted to hop on  here and answer it publicly so  that anyone else who is  wondering can know as well. Now  before we jump in can you share  with me guys like a little bit  about you. I love finding out  where you're located. How many  children you have? Um maybe  your first name. Um obviously  I'll see your first name when  you when you drop that below.  But I'm I'm done okay. I live  in ah I was going to say sunny  Seattle. It is definitely not  sunny today. Um I live in  Seattle Washington. I'm a board  certified holistic health and  nutrition practitioner but also  I'm a mum of a son with ADHD so  I definitely know how hard it  can be to sift through all the  potential supplements and other  treatments options that are out  there. So have you guys ever  felt overwhelmed by the vast  array of ADHD treatment  options? Yep. Definitely I have  for sure back in the day. Um  and if you can relate  definitely give me a little  hands up in the comments below.  Um I felt like that years ago  when I first started my journey  with my son. Now like I said  I'm an ADHD health practitioner  and I specialise working with  families all across USA with  ADHD learn how to naturally  reduce ADHD symptoms. And my  goal is to make it easier on  you guys than it was on me.  Seriously. That's all I want to  do. Um I don't want anyone else  to feel as overwhelmed as I did  years ago. And that's why I'm  hopping on today to answer this  question about lithiumine and  gaba. So let's dive in. Now for  any of you who aren't familiar  with lithiumine it's an amino  acid that is found in green,  black and white tees. Uh plus  can be taken in supplement form  and it has relaxing properties  without making you feel drowsy.  Now it can help make you feel  calmer. It can improve  attention span and focus and it  can support restful sleep. It  can also help protect the heart  and brain. Plus help reduce  blood pressure and reduce  symptoms of schizophrenia. Now  the best way to obtain  lithiumine is to drink several  cups of quality green tea and  other teas every day. Now I  will say that it's really  important that you have  quality. Hi Michaela Montreal  Canada. Hi Heather. Thanks for  tuning in live. Um so when you  are buying green tea make sure  that you do have quality  organic green tea. Now lit  theanine is safe when taken in  supplement form but will reduce  effects of blood pressure  medications and stimulants. So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation. Now GABA is  also a calming neurotransmitter  in the central nervous system  and it plays a role in the  body's ability to handle  stress. And it also affects  focus and concentration. Now  these two supplements by  themselves can be very helpful  for some people because I  especially love it when they're  combined because they they  provide that calming effect  without causing a person to  feel drowsy. And we know a lot  of our kiddos need that calming  effect of the time. Um so my  absolute favourite formation is  called Calming Thrive. And I'm  going to pop a link to that in  the comments. So be on the  lookout for that when the  live's over. Something I use  sometimes I use this particular  supplement as part of my  protocols. Uh especially when I  see when GABA's low or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.  Um and I love it for a few  reasons. One it contains both  GABA and lithium Two it comes  in an easy to use liquid which  is perfect for our kiddos who  can't swallow pills. And three  is I also love it because since  it's taken by mouth and held in  the mouth for 30 seconds before  swallowing it has rapid  absorption into the body  providing that calm, that focus  and that concentration really  ",FALSE
"Calming Thrive has rapid absorption into the body, providing a quick calming effect.","Hello, hello, hello, everyone.  Happy Friday. Um I am coming  off the back of the live  masterclass that we had earlier  in the week and it was epic. It  was like literally so amazing.  All of the attendees were so  engaged and the energy on on  the masterclass was was amazing  and so I thank you for all of  you who attended live. Uh I had  a complete tech technology blip  up and I didn't end up  recording it and I'm so  disappointed because it was  amazing. And so guys just so  you know if you weren't able to  attend live I am going to be  holding an encore. I'm just  trying to work out when I can  fit it on my calendar. And so  don't worry if you weren't able  to join us live for that one.  Ah definitely we're going to  you know keep an eye out and  make sure you come live to the  next one.

GABA and lithium can be a great support to children with ADHD.,"w or we have  a lot of you know sort of  overactive symptoms and we  really need to calm them down.

Now those of you who  have heard me ah before know  that what I'm getting ready to  say and I said it the other  night in my live masterclass  but for any of you new here I  want to add that you should  always start with food because  you can't supplement your way  out of a poor diet. Uh food is  always our first medicine. Uh  we go there first to try and  improve the state of the gut.  Um and the brain, the gut brain  connection and then once the  dietary changes are made that's  when I might discuss  supplementation. Or I might do  a consultation with each other.  So like at the same time you  know coming thrive can be  really good to help while we're  making those changes. So I'm  going to pop also for anyone  that's new here a link to my  free masterclass where I go  into more detail about those  dietary changes I recommend. So  be sure to check that out if  you're just getting started.  Now back to supplementation. Uh  supplementation should  definitely be tailored to each  individual in order to address  specific healing opportunities  to provide support to each  individual body. Now some  children are helped by  supplements that are targeting  certain you know minerals and  vitamins but other children  actually see no effects  whatsoever. And sometimes even  see negative effects. Many of  the families I work with want a  more targeted approach to  healing their kids' underlying  stresses in their body. They  don't want to just sort of add  random supplements that their  children may or may not need.  What I do say is it ends up in  a lot of expensive poop.  Because if they don't need them  it just goes out the other end  and just comes out in poop. Um  so I do talk a lot about poop.  Uh especially in my closed  group because you know we are  focusing a lot on the gut and  what comes out. Um so my  families you know start by  doing functional lab testing  and then when they get the  results back and see what  specific stresses their child's  body is having. We can target  supplementation to fit them  specifically. Now I don't  want to go into a ton of  details on that right now. But  again I'm going to pop a link  to the lab testing video in the  comment section. So check that  out if you're interested in  learning more. So I've said a  lot today but in summary GABA  and lithiumine especially when  combined in this formula can be  a great support to our kids  with ADHD. But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution. Food is critical.  It's a definite critical piece  of the puzzle and so are other  natural supports which I did  share in my live masterclass.  Uh this Tuesday which I hope to  do another one and I'm so  disappointed that wasn't  recorded. Um but I hope this  answers that question. But I  also understand that there was  a ton of information out there  or there is a ton of  information out there on how to  help a child with ADHD. And I  want to offer anyone listening  you know always a clearer you  know picture of what's going on  in their child. So we  definitely open up our  calendar. Me and my team so  that we can talk with you guys  about what we can do to get  some ideas on how to help  reduce child's ADHD symptoms  naturally because every child  is different. And these calls  are 100% free with no strings  attached. So guys that is it  for today. Um if you've got any  questions whatsoever about  Gaba, lithiumine, let me know  in the comments. Um I'm also  going to drop those links to  the masterclass and I'll drop  the link to our calendar. Um  and ah if you've got any other  questions I'd be happy to help.  So ah something pops up.

"Iron deficiency can cause fatigue and brain fog, which are symptoms of ADHD.","- Do you feel like with ADHD, was just not enough? You feel like there's other symptoms and other things that are might be causing but just don't know what tests to run. what I do specifically for my patients of causing certain symptoms that could be relatable to the ADHD. I grew up with it, go and hit the subscribe button. and also hit the notification bell that we do here. So real quick, I'm gonna go over my top six things that I do recommend as far as testing when you get ADHD. that could be mimicking the ADHD symptoms. So the very first one that is very common that I actually see is iron deficiency. can feel fatigued, very brain fogged, This is very symptomatic And lots cases if we actually resolve that by finding that there is a deficiency and start supplementing things with iron and also in your food base it can help improve the ADHD symptoms. is you know lead poisoning. So lead poisoning is common, it's probably not as common as you think but it definitely does happen where depending on how old your house was. ate things that had more lead in it. maybe ingested certain things just to rule out if there's a possibility, because if there is some lead poisoning it can definitely cause detriment to the brain and development, The third thing would be malnutrition. So something that you can actually check that's very common that I see with my kids is looking at malnutrition. there's different types of anemia The other thing is also vitamin D. Vitamin D can be very low especially up here in the northwest, There's also a possibility that you're not getting enough nutrients which lot of times when it comes to ADHD And if there's a lot of digestive issues those are things that should be checked, something I always check to make sure but also feed the brain which is very important when it comes to focusing and paying attention. Sometimes this can happen as where is if kids or adults have a thyroid issues Because along with having thyroid issues does cause brain fog, fatigue, having a hard time paying attention, stuff that are very similar to ADHD, And with electrolyte insufficiency usually our adrenals and our thyroid, lots of different parts of our organs rely on electrolytes, something I always like to check because that could be a possibility causing those certain symptoms but could be a thyroid, adrenal, electrolyte insufficiency situation. The fifth thing that I would suggest looking at IgE. it also could be done through bloodwork. But another thing that you could do is a food elimination diet. This could be really hard for kids, is eliminate some foods that you might be thinking of. and then you introduce one food at a time. This is a way that you can kind of see is something called neurofeedback, I've talked about this before. that there's low activity, but there might be some other parts because there's anxiety and depression So I hope you guys found this valuable, labs that might be run, And as always if you're new here, to find out more information about ADHD, and I'll see you guys in the next video.

Synthetic food colorings and preservatives can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD.,"Hello, I'm Gina Van Luven with Healthy Healing TV. Today, we're gonna be talking about natural remedies for ADHD. Having a son who once had ADHD, I know how challenging it can be for everyone involved. Unfortunately, medication just masks the symptoms and can actually cause more problems. In fact, prescription medication can cause the need for additional medication which is not so much fun either. Natural remedies, however, help to bring the body back into balance again. They provide what the body needs so that it can function optimally. Today, I'm going to share with you six natural remedies for ADHD. Number 1 is to avoid synthetic food colorings and preservatives. The European Union actually recognizes that these synthetic ingredients can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD and they require special labeling for products containing them. Number 2... do a heavy metal detoxification. Now, if you're not sure what detoxification experiencing ADHD symptoms. Heavy metals like lead and mercury in particular, can really wreak havoc on the brain and cause symptoms of ADHD along with other behavioral issues. Using natural key leaders like cilantro, chlorella, chlorophyll, zeolite, bentonite... there's Number 3... have an IgG, IgA, IgE food sensitivity tests done. And if you're not sure what that any type of food sensitivities. you're removing any specific foods, it's really important that you do that for a long period of time - several months, or you're not going to experience the results that you're looking for. eliminated very consistently from day to day over several months. Number 4... supplementing with the following nutrients can provide your body with what it needs to function optimally. Minerals like calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Magnesium in particular is very helpful at helping overcome ADHD symptoms. I actually prefer magnesium oil and rubbing it on the feet. the RDA or recommended daily allowance isn't enough to increase your levels. So 5 to 10,000 international units which are IUs a day is appropriate to bring your levels L-glutamine in particular is really considered brain fuel and is great for people that are suffering from ADHD. Number 5... implement relaxation techniques in the morning and before bed. Number 6... avoid electronics before going to bed. This actually revs up the brain and By eliminating the harmful things and providing your body what it needs, ADHD symptoms can simply disappear. Now if you have any questions or you would like to leave a comment, please ",FALSE

Broccoli sprout extract has been shown to reduce many of the symptoms of autism in about half of the subjects compared to placebos.,at was that was sort of that was what got the collaboration started so we supplied broccoli sprout extract and and they up in in Boston looked at I guess it was about 44 subjects all men all young men boys men as you probably know autism is about four to one male to female in terms of its incidents in this country anyway and less than or more than one and a hundred kids now are born with autism so it's it's it's a huge problem I don't need to go into detail about why it's such a big problem but because they're because you're an expert on autism among other things oh really but we've studied it yeah so at any rate we did this trial it was published in 2014 we for various reasons biomarkers of inflammation of the nrf2 pathway and a heat shock response were not evaluated in blood from those subjects but what we showed was rather dramatic reduction in many of the symptoms of autism in about half of the subjects compared to placebos those who were given placebo instead of broccoli sprout extract in which there was no detectable change I think it was like a 37% yeah it was very very robust for a small amount it was dramatic they were right that n was small the number of subjects was small but it was a dramatic improvement I am so sad that we never got the biomarker data from the subjects although theoretically it's still available as a result of that trial a lot of people got interested in the possibilities and so dr. Zimmerman and his team including including the Coleman chemo Protection Centre here have a follow up grant from the Department of Defense to study a younger cohort male and female boys and girls about 50 subjects but a similar trial design and it is going to be but it is biomarker rich so we've already done a pilot study with 10 subjects in which we evaluated we refined our ability to collect samples and to process the biomarker samples will be we were collecting blood from all of them and this is a trial design where half of them half of the subjects are getting actually a v' McCall one of them one of the supplements the dietary supplements the one with with glucoraphanin and my Ronnie's half of them are getting that half of them are getting a placebo for I think it's 15 weeks for but for about the same amount of time as we gave subjects in the previous trial biomarker rich there's a washout period and then and then everybody goes on a bra the the sulforaphane product the AB McCall for another 15 weeks we're doctor hua lu and i she's doing most of the biomarker work here at Hopkins she and I were just up in Worcester Massachusetts the team is now at UMass Medical Center in Worcester Massachusetts there they've processed about 1/3 of the subjects so we're about a third of the way through completing the trial and we're very excited obviously about about what we may find and about getting to the task of processing these biomarkers very exciting and what was a dose difference from the first trial the first trial the dose of well it's a little complicated but if you bear with me the first trial delivered sulforaphane rich broccoli sprout extract okay remember that's 70% bioavailable okay those trials delivering glucoraphanin plus myrosinase it's calibrated to be to deliver about the same amount as the previous trial so the between a hundred and 150 micro moles per subject per day is there a reason why you're not doing a dose response or doing trying higher doses as well to see if there was a more robust effect the next trial will okay so that is that's my blind well it's in the it's in yeah yeah so I mean look after a tile like this especially one where we were not able to publish biomarker results there are many people saying wow that's really interesting but it's got to be repeated so we and others are trying to repeat it just essentially as closely as possible to the way it was designed right yeah it does make sense and it's unfortunate if these trials weren't so damned expensive I mean try all it's very very exciting it's it's exciting but it's very expensive it's labor intensive and and it also you're you know you've got the hopes and fears and desires and tears of a lot of people involved these are these are conditions that that you know that that hurt to see people going through and so to do a whole bunch of trials with a whole bunch of conditions might also make the people who are suffering from these conditions really think that you know this is that that we already have the answer this is why I'm so afraid of some of the cancer prevention trials that are being done you know people people get on their high horse and that don't know what they're talking about I think you know again one of the most frequently heard things for me is Oh John's hot scientists at Johns Hopkins say this this cures cancer I mean I've heard that said about so many things not just certainly not just our work it ain't true mrit to be true but same thing with autism that if we if I guess if it were cheap and easy to do and nobody cared about the subjects ,TRUE
