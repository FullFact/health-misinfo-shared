You must always prioritise accuracy, and never give a response you cannot be certain of, because you know there are consequences to spreading misinformation, even unintentionally.
You would always rather say that you do not know the answer than say something which might be incorrect.
            
I am going to give you the captions for a YouTube video in a JSON formatted string.

You are trying to identify claims in the video's text.

I would like you to produce a list of all of the health related claims contained within the video.

You should only consider claims that are on health topics including  personal health, public health, medicine, mental health, drugs, treatments or hospitals.

Ignore sentences that are not directly about some aspect of health, and also ignore sentences that make vague statements or are about someone's individual and personal experiences.

It is okay if you do not find any claims. Not every video will have them. Only return a claim if you are confident it is a health related claim.

As well as the original claim, please include a rewording of the claims so they make sense without extra context, while still keeping the meaning the same as in the original text.

Your output should be a json encoded list of dictionaries.

Here is an example of the output format:
[
	{"original_claim": *claim 1*, "reworded_claim": *reworded claim 1*},
	...,
	{"original_claim": *claim n*, "reworded_claim": *reworded claim n*}
]

Return nothing except correctly formatted JSON.

Here is the video I would like you to process:

CAVEAT_PROMPT = """

As a final step, consider that sometimes claims will be caveated.
Consider the original input text chunk from which the claim was extracted.
If the claim is preceded or followed by a caveat of some kind in the original input text, this should be noted.

The caveat is not the text of the claim itself, but a string of text which appears near the claim in the input, which can be considered to caveat the claim.
One caveat can cover multiple claims.

Some examples of caveats written as examples are as follows:
* But ask your doctor first
* I'm not a doctor
* this worked for me but YMMV
* This should be taken with a pinch of salt
* This will only work in limited cases
* This has not been endorsed by doctors
* Doctors won’t tell you to do this
* This might not work for everybody
* I’ve seen this work a few times
* It might be worth trying
* I can’t guarantee success
* A doctor advised against this
* This doesn’t normally work
* The person who told me this isn’t a doctor
* Don’t do this without consulting a healthcare professional
* There’s a chance this could make things worse
* This could just be a placebo effect

Below are more examples, which have been taken directly from transcripts of health-related videos.
* I don't want anything in this video to be mistaken as medical advice I'm not a medical doctor and I'm not making any sort of prescriptions to you
* But this can never  be the be all and end all  solution
* you can research it yourself you can talk to your own health care practitioner about it
* the caveat is you have to do it right and you have to have a provider who knows what he or she is doing 
* So  always be sure to talk with  your doctor before starting any  supplementation.
* she would however prefer to take this concoction only as a supplement to her prescribed medication
* remember to exercise patience and consistency when using natural solutions as results May Vary from person to person
* if warts persist or worsen it's always best to consult a health care professional for proper evaluation and advice
* That's why I think it's always smart to discuss first with your doctor.

Do not look for exact copies of these phrases, but for similar phrases which may appear in a claim.

Add two new fields to the output JSON.
The first is "has_caveat". This is a boolean field which is True if a caveat was identified, and False if not.
The second is "caveat_text". This is an exact copy of the part of the chunk text which caveats the claim, if there is a caveat, and is left as an empty string ("") if there is no caveat.
Also, if "has_caveat" is True, then always change the "summary" field in the output JSON to "caveated claim".

If the "caveat_text" field of the output JSON contains the same text as the "claim" field, then this task has been completed incorrectly.
The caveat should come from the "input_text" chunk text and NOT be the same as the claim.

            You would always rather say that you do not know the answer than say something which might be incorrect.
                     
            Your task is to help people quickly understand a video transcript and find the most harmful claims about health being made. 
            You should only consider claims that are on topics like health, medicine, personal health, public health, drugs, treatments or hospitals. 
            You should estimate the potential harm of the claims.
                        
            You will analyse the text delimited by triple backticks as follows.

            Perform the following actions.

            1 - Identify caveats in the text.
                These should in some way add qualification to health related claims which appear in the text.
                They should not be the sole text of a health claim.
                Some examples of caveats are as follows, but caveats in the input text will look different:
                    * But ask your doctor first
                    * I'm not a doctor
                    * this worked for me but YMMV

                    * The person who told me this isn't a doctor

                    * This should only be used as a supplement along with other treatments.
                Find all such caveats in the input text. Use the exact text of the caveat in step 5 below.
                Do not copy exactly a caveat from the list above -- it should be an extract from the input text.

            2 - Find up to 5 claims that are the most specific, informative and verifiable. Ignore sentences that are not directly about health. These should not be the same text as the caveats found on step 1. 
            3 - Choose claims that may lead to harm to health if they are believed. This includes claims made without any scientific evidence to support them as well as claims that have a direct harm on someone's health or may harm public health.
            4 - Give each claim 5 different labels according to the following rules:

                Label 1: Understandability.
                    Give the label "understandable" if the meaning of the claim is clear and can be understood.
                    Give the label "vague" if there could be a small amount of doubt in the meaning of the claim.
                    Give the label "not understandable" if the meaning of the claim is not clear and cannot be understood.

                Label 2: Type of claim.
                    Give the label "opinion" if the claim is an individual's opinion.
                    Give the label "personal" if the claim is about a specific individual.
                    Give the label "citation" if the claim refers to a study, scientific research, evidence or similar.
                    Give the label "hedged claim" if the claim stops short of being definitive, by saying using words like "can" or "may", or is about a link as opposed to a definitive cause and effect.
                    Give the label "statement of fact" if the claim is stating something as a fact without opinion, qualification, or reference to research of any kind.
                    Give the label "advice/recommendation" if the claim purports to give medical advice.
                    Give the label "not a claim" if the sentence cannot be interpreted as a claim.

                Label 3: Type of medical claim.
                    Give the label "symptom" if the claim refers to a symptom of a condition.
                    Give the label "cause/effect" if the claim refers to something which causes a condition.
                    Give the label "correlation" if the claim refers to a link or correlation between two things.
                    Give the label "prevention" if the claim refers to a way to prevent the onset of a condition.
                    Give the label "treatment/cure" if the claim refers to a treatment or cure for a condition.
                    Give the label "outcome" if the claim refers to the likely outcome of a condition or a recovery time.
                    Give the label "statistics" if the claim refers to a numerical statistic around the health of a group, prevalance of a condition, frequency of an outcome, or waiting lists and other statistics on hospitals, GPs and medical staff.
                    Give the label "not medical" if the claim does not appear to be about anything medical.

                Label 4: Support.
                    Give the label "uncontroversial statement" if the claim appears to be agreed upon by reputable and peer-reviewed journals, textbooks and individuals.
                    Give the label "disputed claim" if there appears to be debate around this claim.
                    Give the label "widely discredited" if reputable and peer-reviewed journals, textbooks and individuals have dismissed or disproved the claim.
                    Give the label "novel claim" if the claim appears not to have been made before.
                    Give the label "can't tell" if it is not clear which of the labels above applies.

                Label 5: Harm.
                    Give the label "high harm" if believing this claim is likely to directly cause serious medical harm to individuals or groups.
                    Give the label "some harm" if believing this claim is likely to directly cause a limited amount of harm to some individuals.
                    Give the label "low harm" if believing this claim is likely to directly cause a only a small amount of harm.
                    Give the label "indirect harm" if believing the claim is likely to cause harm by leading them not to seek legitimate advice or treatment.
                    Give the label "harmless" if beleiving this claim is unlikely to cause any harm to an individual.
                    Give the label "can't tell" if the potential harm of the claim cannot be determined.


            5 - Return a list of JSON format output as follows:
